# Fire-Detection-and-Alarm-System
** Academic Project **

Fire outbreak is a common issue happening everywhere in the world. It represents a real threat to human lives, ecological systems, and infrastructure. Therefore, Fire Detection is valuable. An Early Fire Detection would warn us and a big disaster can be averted. The project aims to develop an efficient fire detection system that comes as a warning to reduce the losses caused by hazardous fire.

Fire can be considered an unfortunate phenomenon that can cause catastrophic damage to property and environment. It can also pose an immense threat to human safety and lives, especially when this hazard gets out of control. A large destructive fire that spreads over a large area leads to damage to humans, environment, property and animals too. Homes can be destroyed. Forest fires are usually detected late and cause great harm to animals and the environment. Due to power failure, accidental fire, natural lightning, thousands of accidents related to fire happen all over the world yearly. Due to urbanization, more and more buildings appear around us which will cause damage to life and property if caught fire. Thus, demanding the need of fire detection.

Vision-based fire detection approaches provide better accuracy than Traditional Fire Detection techniques. But in image processing techniques (based on open CV), the rate of false alarm is high as detection of fire is not accurate. Sometimes the yellow cloth and sunlight are detected as fire due to the same color.

So for proper detection of fire, we have proposed a Fire Detection technique that is based on powerful machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We have used CNN and the Inception V3 model to detect fire. There are approx. 1200 images out of which approx. 980 images are a part of the training set and 239 for validation. The model is trained by applying various convolution, MaxPooling, dense and dropout layers. The accuracy comes out to be 96.6% and hence the model is fit to serve the purpose of fire detection and can yield optimal results.
